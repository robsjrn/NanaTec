		       <h3>Condos & Townhouses for Rent</h3>
		
				<p>If you don't want to deal with lawn maintenance or come up with a down payment, renting a condo or a townhouse may be right for you. Because many of our listings are placed by individual landlords, Rentals.com provides more listings for condos and townhouses than anywhere else, including the classifieds. We'll help you find the perfect rental home for you.</p>
				<h3>Condos for Rent</h3>

				<p>Condominiums are typically part of a multi-unit dwelling where a homeowner's association manages common areas. With a condo, the owner or tenant is only responsible for the area located within the walls of their unit. Condos have become very popular in recent years, so many cities have an abundance of new construction. Renting a condo is a great way to get started in a new city.
				</p>


				<h3>Townhouses for Rent</h3>
				<p>Trying to decide among an apartment, condo, house or townhouse for rent? A townhouse gives you similar amenities to a condo or apartment, yet comes with the benefits of a house. Some townhomes come with garages, small yards, large kitchens and fireplaces. A townhouse tenant often is responsible for the area inside the unit as well as the land the unit sits on. Some townhouse communities have common area maintenance included, while others don't. Be sure to ask the landlord about your responsibilities before signing a lease.
